🚖SafeRide – Women Safety-First Mobility Platform(designed by AlgoNauts)

📌 Project Overview

SafeRide is a women-centric, safety-first ride booking platform designed to provide secure, accessible, and reliable transportation. The solution focuses on proactive safety using AI, offline emergency support, and multiple booking modes to ensure help is available even in extreme situations such as low internet connectivity or low battery.

This repository contains the website (web MVP) code used to demonstrate the core idea and flows of the solution. A separate Figma prototype was created to showcase the complete user experience and app screens.

🚨 Problem Statement

Women often face safety risks while traveling, especially during late hours, in unfamiliar areas, or in regions with poor network connectivity. Existing ride-hailing platforms mainly rely on manual panic buttons and lack proactive safety detection, offline emergency support, and women-focused systems—limiting women’s confidence, mobility, and independence.

---

💡 Solution Overview

AlgoNauts addresses these challenges by combining AI-based risk detection, multi-tier SOS, and offline emergency mechanisms (USSD/SMS) within a women-only ecosystem of verified riders and drivers. The platform ensures transparency, privacy, and accessibility through Google technologies, while also empowering women via driver training and mentorship programs.

✨ Key Features

* Women-only verified riders and drivers
* AI-based risk detection (route deviation, long stops, voice distress cues)
* Multi-tier SOS (emergency contacts → nearby women drivers → control system)
* Offline emergency support using USSD / SMS
* Voice-activated help and local language support
* Live ride tracking and one-tap sharing with trusted contacts
* Multiple booking modes: App, Website, Bot, Call
* Strong privacy standards with secure authentication and data control

---

🛠️ Google Technologies Used

* Firebase Authentication – Secure user login and verification
* Cloud Firestore – Encrypted storage of user, ride, and SOS data
* Firebase Cloud Functions – SOS workflows and real-time alert handling
* Firebase Security Rules – Controlled and protected data access
* Google Maps API – Live location tracking and route monitoring
* Google ML Kit / Speech-to-Text – Voice trigger detection and risk analysis

---

🧪 MVP Details

* Website MVP: Demonstrates core flows such as booking interface, SOS trigger, and system logic
* Figma Prototype (separate): Shows detailed app screens, user journeys, and complete UX
* Focus: Proof of concept for safety, not a full production system

 ▶️ How to Run the Project (Website)

1. Clone the repository:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/algonauts.git
   
2. Navigate to the project folder:

   bash
   cd algonauts
   
3. Open home.html in a browser
   (or run a local server if required by the setup)

> Note: Backend services (Firebase, Maps, AI) are demonstrated at a conceptual or limited MVP level for hackathon purposes.

🚀 Future Scope

* Integration with police, NGOs, and emergency services
* Advanced AI model training for improved risk and voice detection
* Expansion to rural and low-connectivity regions
* Driver training, certification, and mentorship programs
* In-app feedback, safety ratings, and community reporting
* Campus and institutional partnerships for adoption
